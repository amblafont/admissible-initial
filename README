This is an ongoing formalisation on some ongoing work
about Initial Semantics for admissible operations.

It is based on the UniMath library.

Some proofs were semi-generated from the diagram editor 
https://amblafont.github.io/graph-editor/index.html, based
on the commutative diagrams saved in the json files.
